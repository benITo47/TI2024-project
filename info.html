        <p class="section-description">
          The Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool designed to help users understand
          and visualize how various graph search algorithms work. This tool
          supports two modes:
        </p>
        <ul class="info-list">
          <li>
            <strong>2D Grid Mode:</strong> A grid-based visualization where
            algorithms find paths from a start point to an endpoint.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Graph Mode:</strong> A general graph visualization with
            nodes and edges, ideal for non-grid-based structures.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="section-description">
          The visualizer allows you to select start and end points, place walls
          or weights, and then run your chosen algorithm to see how it searches
          for a path. Each step of the algorithm is animated to provide an
          intuitive understanding of its mechanics.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description">
          In grid mode, the grid cells represent nodes, and adjacent cells are
          connected. In graph mode, nodes and edges are represented as circles
          and lines, respectively, with longer edges representing bigger
          weights.

          <h3>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>
          <p>
            BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving
            deeper. It guarantees the shortest path. BFS is ideal for scenarios
            where finding the shortest path is critical.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="algorithm-description">
          <h3>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>
          <p>
            DFS dives deep into one branch before backtracking. It does not
            guarantee the shortest path but is useful for exploring all possible
            paths in a graph.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="algorithm-description">
          <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path in weighted graphs. It
            uses a priority queue to explore nodes in order of their accumulated
            cost from the start node.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="algorithm-description">
          <h3>A* Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            A* is a heuristic-based search algorithm that combines the strengths
            of Dijkstra's algorithm and a heuristic function. It is faster than
            Dijkstra when a good heuristic is provided, and it guarantees the
            shortest path.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>In grid mode</span>, A* uses the Manhattan distance as its
            heuristic, which calculates the distance between two points based on
            a grid layout (horizontal and vertical steps only).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>In graph mode</span>, A* uses a Euclidean distance-based
            heuristic, calculated as the straight-line distance between two
            nodes:
